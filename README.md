# dino

dino is the clone of the t-rex game that appears on 404 ERROR_CONNECTION on Chrome, build it without canvas or any game-engine.
Just react, redux and redux-saga.

## Purposes
- Learn how to manage async operations on redux.
- Stress the performance on a high op/s system.
- Build my first 2D game on HTML5 without any game-engine(like [phaser](http://phaser.io) or [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com))

## Run it on local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davesnx/dino
cd dino
npm install
npm start
```
